comments: Decided to give CAMCUSTOM a call for a quote after I had another
  contractor NOT complete a job that I had paid for. They came out gave me the
  quote and not only did they complete the job but I was so impressed with their
  work and professionalism that I hired them to paint my whole house outside.
  The work they did was beyond my expectations! I have a whole new house! I had
  to end up calling them again for some minor electrical and plumbing work, and
  again they did not disappoint! Will I call them again? Absolutely! My go to
  guys from here on out!
