# CAM Custom Contracting
This is a website I built for a client for his startup home renovation business located in the Houston, TX area. The client wanted a simple "landing page" type website where he could post pictures of various jobs in varying levels of completion, and a contact form so customers would be able to get quotes for their home renovation projects. 

# Technologies Used
- VueJS with Gridsome for SEO and SSR
- Netlify and Netlify CMS for hosting and content management
